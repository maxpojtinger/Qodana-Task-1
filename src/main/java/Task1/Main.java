            The runtime complexity of scanning and splitting our input should be O(n*m) (n = number of input strings, m = maximum number of characters in our string)
            It may be possible to do this more efficiently, but because there is a limit of 100 names with 100 characters at most, I won't try to optimize it any further, since it won't make a practical difference.
            Doing it like this removes the necessity to sort the list of names by their placement stated in the integer part of the input strings separately.
            However, by doing it like this, we need to trust the user to never denote input strings with integers already used or outside the boundaries (i âˆˆ [1,n]).
            This is something you can easily fix. Just add a hash set, in which you're saving all denotations and then check with the contains method, if the number is already in our set.
            Then you need to check every "parts[i]" separately for being inside our boundaries or not.
            I'm also not checking for the 100 characters limit and for our string only containing small letters.
            I'm trusting you guys for only using words like name%i, just like you stated on your website.
